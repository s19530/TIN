            <p>The title Old Russian serves to denote the language of the earliest documents of the eastern branch of the Slavic
                family of languages. The composition of the oldest surviving documents generally dates to some time within the 10th century AD.
                The term Old Russian is something of a misnomer in that the initial stages of the language which it denotes predate
                the dialectal divisions which mark the nascent distinction between modern Russian, Belorussian, and Ukrainian.
                Thus Old Russian serves as a common parent to all three of the major East Slavic languages, and as such a more appropriate term
                for the language is Old East Slavic. Unfortunately, in addition to being cumbersome, this terminology is not universally applied
                even within modern scholarship. Moreover, as the language Old Russian formed the medium of communication throughout
                the lands of the Rus [RusÄ­], about whom we will have more to say elsewhere in these lessons, some scholars employ the term Rusian for Old Russian.
                This is perhaps the most convenient of all the terms, but lamentably it is also the least commonly used.</p>
